- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacksonwrightjr!
- I'm a junior Computer Science major with a minor in Cybersecurity at Texas A&M University.
- I like to work on electric skateboards, cars, practically anything that involves computers working in tandem with moving parts.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about data structures, functional programming languages, and the "in-between" of hardware to software (assemblers and low-level programming)
- I have experience in Haskell, C++, Java, Python, and some frontend development. I am reworking my website away from template design to make it my own.
- Currently, I'm working on a web scraper that utilizes the Selenium and iCalEvents packages in Python to streamline picking up shifts at my part-time job.
- How to reach me: email me at jacksonwrightjr@tamu.edu!
